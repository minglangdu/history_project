    <h1>Civil War Ciphers</h1>
    <h2>The Route Cipher</h2>

    <p> The route cipher was an example of how more practical aspects give a 
      cipher an edge over other ciphers. Unlike the rail-fence and vigenere 
      ciphers that the Confederates used, it left words mostly intact. However, 
      while this may seem like a glaring flaw, this characteristic is one of 
      the cipher's main strengths, since its ciphertext is easily remembered. 
      The complete words in the route cipher drastically decreased the amount 
      of human error. 
    </p>
    <p> The route cipher was also strong. As you can see in the above image (drawn
      by me), the plaintext was obscured extremely well; no information about the 
      actual purpose or meaning of the message can be gleaned just from reading it. 
      Even skilled cryptanalysts, who were able to break the vigenere and rail-fence
      ciphers, couldn't break the route cipher. Confederate newspapers would often 
      publish ciphertext in their newspapers, but few encrypted texts were ever able 
      to be solved.
    </p>
    <h2>The Rail-Fence Cipher</h2>

    <p> The rail-fence cipher was a cipher that used transposition. It was not strong 
      since both sides knew it and used it, and it could be easily decrypted if the 
      decrypter knew that a rail-fence cipher was being used. Meanwhile, if a decrypter
      knew that the route cipher was being used, they would still have a high chance of 
      failing to crack the message because there were many, many routes.
