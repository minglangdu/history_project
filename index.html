    <h1>History Project</h1>
    <p>This website contains explanations, demos, and other supplementary material for my (Minglang Du) history project 
      on the history of cryptography in the U.S.
    </p>
    <p> I gathered information from a variety of sources when creating this project, all linked in this google doc

          <h1><i>1778</i> - The Culper Spy Ring</h1>
          <p> The Culper Spy Ring was organized in New York to gather information about the regulars' 
            activities during the Revolutionary War. Its leader, Major Benjamin Tallmadge, came up with 
            the idea of using a codebook as a substitution cipher, storing 763 numbers mapping to names,
            places, and words. Unfortunately, numbers 277, 278, 279, and 617 are damaged and unreadable.</p>

          <h1><i>1804-1806</i>: Lewis and Clark</h1>
          <p> Lewis and Clark, by the suggestion of Thomas Jefferson, sent messages encoded in the Vigenère cipher, 
            which was a significant improvement from the pure substitution of the Tallmadge codes. This cipher was
            based on an algorithm, not a codebook, and thus was convenient. It only required a Vigenère tableau and 
            the knowledge of a single codeword to encrypt and decrypt text.

          <h2>The Route Cipher</h2>
          <p> Anson Stager created the route cipher during the civil war to be an easily-relayed 
            yet strong cipher. While it seemed weak since it kept the words intact, the route 
            cipher's combination of substitution, transposition, and dummy words made it extremely
            difficult to break; Confederate newspapers would often publish ciphertext in their 
            newspapers, but few encrypted texts were able to be solved. Additionally, since people
            can transmit words better than letters, there was little loss of meaning due to the "broken
            telephone effect."

          <h2>The Rail-Fence Cipher</h2>
          <p> The rail-fence cipher was a weak cipher that was used in the civil war by both sides, and 
            was inferior to the route cipher in many ways. It was hard to communicate since it scrambled
            the words, causing many ciphertexts to be so corrupted by human error that decrypting them would 
            yield gibberish. Additionally, it only used one weak transposition to encrypt plaintext, unlike the 
            route cipher's synergy between transposition and substitution.

          <p> First patented and created at the end of WWI for commercial purposes, the 
            Enigma would later be used in WWII to encrypt critical messages sent by 
            Nazi Germany. Both the invention itself and the decryption of its codes were 
            significant milestones for cryptography, greatly advancing the field's discovery. 
            The enigma used a keyboard for input, a lampboard for output, rotors to scramble 
            the text, and a
