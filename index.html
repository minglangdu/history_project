          <h2><i>1778</i> - The Culper Spy Ring</h2>
          <p> The Culper Spy Ring was organized in New York to gather information about the regulars' 
            activities during the Revolutionary War. Its leader, Major Benjamin Tallmadge, came up with 
            the idea of using a codebook as a substitution cipher, storing 763 numbers mapping to names,
            places, and words. Unfortunately, numbers 277, 278, 279, and 617 are damaged and unreadable.</p>

          <h2><i>1804</i> - Lewis and Clark</h2>
          <p> Lewis and Clark, by the suggestion of Thomas Jefferson, sent messages encoded in the Vigenère cipher, 
            which was a significant improvement from the pure substitution of the Tallmadge codes. This cipher was
            based on an algorithm, not a codebook, and thus was convenient. It only required a Vigenère tableau and 
            the knowledge of a single codeword to encrypt and decrypt text.
