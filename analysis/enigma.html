    <h1>The Enigma</h1>

    <p> The enigma was created to try to thwart frequency analysis, the bane of all polyalphabetic
        substitution ciphers. Since no frequencies could be found in a cipher that made its 
        encrypted outputs purely random, these "rotor machines" were being made by inventors 
        to make their outputs more purely random, and make repetitions much less common. 
    </p>
    <p> The enigma was the machine that protected Nazi Germany's most important secrets, 
        and both the invention itself and the decoding of its code were extremely important 
        to the field of cryptography. Originally used to encode banking secrets, this machine 
        became used to encrypt military information as well. Its multiple settings allowed for
        158 quintillion different encryption methods, making it nearly impossible to perform
        a "brute force" (trying every possibility) attack. 
    </p>
    <p> The enigma achieved this using its rotors and plugboard. The machine had five rotors,
        though only three could be set to be used at a time. Each combination of orientations 
        for the active three rotors (which had 26 positions for each letter) represented one 
        distinct cryptography scheme. Each rotor was its own sort of Caesar cipher, shifting 
        letters down the alphabet. However, there were three of these ciphers, with the first
        linking its output to the second, and the second linking its output to the third. After 
        the typed letter went through the three rotors, it would go back, becoming the third 
        rotor's input so that the letter would go back out in another direction. Additionally,
        as a letter was typed, the leftmost rotor would rotate once till it reached its original
        position, after which the next rotor would rotate. The last rotor would rotate once the
        second rotor completed a full revolution. 
    </p>
    <p> The plugboard added an entire layer of complexity onto the already complex system. A total
        of 13 tubes could be wired between the 26 holes in the plugboard that represented each 
        letter. These tubes would substitute both the input and the output; typing the letter 'F'
        could make it substitute into 'C' if 'F' and 'C' were linked, and the enigma outputting 
        the letter 'M' could make it substitute into 'B' if 'M' and 'B' were linked. 
    </p>
    <p> Going back to that 158 quintillion statistic, we can multiply the different possibilities 
        created by each part. The three active rotors of the machine had 26 * 26 * 26 possible 
        starting arrangements, making 17576 combinations. There would also be 5P3 = 60 ways to choose 
        rotors and the rotor order. The plugboard increased the combination drastically, with 150 
        trillion ways to connect the different parts of the keyboard. Finally, we multiply them to get
        17576 * 150000000000000 * 60 equals 158 quintillion combinations.
