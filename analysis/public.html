    <p> Public-key cryptography is a major breakthrough for cryptography because it involves the 
      use of multiple keys, a public key and a private key. Having a key that can be shared freely
      and a key that is kept only to oneself, this area of cryptography has multiple different applications. 
    </p>
    <h2>Sending Messages</h2>
    <p> Under a public-key system, anyone can send messages to someone if they know that person's 
      public key, which they are able to know. However, these messages can only be read by the 
      intended reader, so intercepters are unable to decode what the messages are. This is because 
      the public and private keys are mathematically related to each other, so only the private key 
      is able to decrypt the public key. 
    </p>
    <p> This system is advantageous in a variety of ways. Under a symmetric key (one key) system, 
      both the sender and receiver must keep the cipher secret in order for intercepters not to 
      decrypt messages. This is not always easy, especially if communication is scrutinized and 
      it is difficult to privately tell someone the encryption key. Public-key cryptography changes 
      this because the private key, the only key that needs to be protected in this system, does 
      not need to be told to anyone. Only the public key needs to be told, and it doesn't need to be 
      kept secret.
    </p>
    <h2>Digital Signatures</h2>
    <p> Public-key cryptography can also be used to confirm that a piece of information is created 
      by who it purports to be affilliated with. The text to be sent has a "signature" applied to 
      it using a special program that takes the owner's private key. Then, people who know the author's 
      public key are able to easily confirm that the information is signed by the author. However, 
      forgers don't know the author's private key so they cannot sign text such that it returns the same 
      thing when tested with the author's public key. 
    </p>
    <h2>Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</h2>
    <p> The Diffie-Hellman Key exchange uses public-key cryptography to create a single cipher, a 
      "shared secret," but with all of the advantages of sending messages with "normal" public-key 
      cryptography. Special parameters are agreed upon for new public keys, but these parameters 
      do not give away the actual keys so they can be spoken in a scrutinized space. Then, these 
      parameters are combined with each party's private key to create a public key, which still 
      doesn't give away the keys. Finally, a shared secret is created by combining the public and 
      private keys, without giving away the actual code to eavesdroppers.
