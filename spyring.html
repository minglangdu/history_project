    <p>This early form of cipher is purely a substitution cipher, a cipher that 
    replaces specific units of plaintext with ciphertext in a defined manner
    as dictated by a key. Here, the units of plaintext are words, and the key is of
    course the spy ring codebook.</p>
    <p>These codes are very rudimentary and would obviously not work well today since
    a single intercepted codebook could mean the end of an operation, and it would be
    inevitable that one codebook was taken. Additionally, these codes are 
    not vulnerable to one major flaw of pure substitution ciphers, 
    <a href="https://www.101computing.net/frequency-analysis/">frequency analysis</a>. 
    Frequency analysis is essentially finding how frequently some letters (or words)
    appear in normal text, and comparing that to how frequently the substituted letters
    appeared. 
    </p>
    <p>As a result, these codes are only examples of how cryptography was employed even
    in the beginning of the Revolutionary War. Comparing their flaws to new ciphers now
    shows how far we have come in terms of cryptography.
