    <p> The vigenere cipher can be thought of as a better form of a Caesar cipher, a cipher that
      encodes plaintext by shifting letters a fixed distance down the alphabet (famously used
      by Caesar himself). While the Caesar cipher shifts letters down the same amount for any 
      letter, the vigenere cipher shifts letters down based on a repeated codeword.
    </p>
    <p> To encrypt using the vigenere cipher, the plaintext is first written out. Then, a selected
      codeword is written over the plaintext, with each letter of the codeword matching each letter
      of the plaintext. For example, if the codeword was "EVERY" and the plaintext was "grandpa", the 
      letters would be overlaid like this.
      <pre>|E|V|E|R|Y|E|V|
   |g|r|a|n|d|p|a|
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p> This is how the cipher decides how much it shifts letters down the alphabet: using the codeword. 
      In the example that Thomas Jefferson sent to Lewis and Clark, if the letter of the codeword above 
      a plaintext letter was "A", then the plaintext letter would be shifted down once ("a" would become
      "b", "b" would become "c", and "z" would become "a.") However, this would be quite tedious when long
      messsages would have to be encrypted. This is where the vigenere tableau comes in. As you can see in 
      the image above, the vigenere tableau is a matrix with rows and columns. The columns represent plaintext,
      while the rows represent the repeated codeword. This tableau's rows contain various Caesar ciphers with
      different shifts down the alphabet, helping to reduce the work needed a little bit. 
    </p>
    <p> One advantage of the vigenere cipher is that it is hard to crack using frequency analysis, a method
      of decoding substitution ciphers by finding the frequencies the words appear in. For example, a simple
      Caesar cipher that shifted "e" to "f" would be easily broken using frequency analysis. Decrypters would
      find that "f" appeared as frequently in the ciphertext as "e" does in normal text. They would then repeat 
      this analysis on other letters and find what each letter mapped to. However, vigenere encrypts letters in 
      many different ways due to its codeword. Thus, what the frequencies map to is less obvious; the appearances 
      of "e" or other letters are spread among many different encrypted letters. 
    </p>
    <h2>Breaking the Vigenere Cipher</h2>
    <p> While the cipher would've worked for Lewis and Clark, you should definitely not use it to encrypt 
      your secrets now! The cipher was broken with the ingenuity of Charles Babbage in 1854, though his findings
      were only published in the 1970s, decades after his death. The principle behind his solution is that 
      while the vigenere cipher decreased repetitions in the plaintext, the codeword cycled, meaning that a repetition
      would be inevitable. Thus, an improved frequency analysis could still break the cipher. 
    </p>
    <p> Cracking the cipher begins with analyzing repeated sequences in the ciphertext in order to find possible lengths
      of the codeword. For example, if the letters "BIY" are repeated and the distance between the end of the first occurrence
      and the end of the second occurrence is 35, the codeword's length could be 5 or 7. We repeat this analysis of repeated 
      sequences for each repetition, helping us find a set of possible codeword lengths. The more sequences where a length 
      is possible, the more likely that the codeword has that length. 
    </p>
    <p> Now that we know the length, we can finally do our trusty frequency analysis! This is because we now know which letters
      of the ciphertext are encrypted by which part of the codeword. For example, if the codeword's length is 7, that means that 
      the first, eighth, fifteenth, etc. are encrypted by the first part of the codeword. So, as those letters are effectively
      encrypted with a Caesar cipher, we can crack them using simple frequency analysis. We then repeat for each codeword letter 
      to get the plaintext.
